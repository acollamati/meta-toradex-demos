    the first few minutes until completed
- Display resolution can be set for some output configurations, set the U-Boot
    environment variable vidargs accordingly.
- X uses only the fb0 device
- Ethernet aka TFTP update requires manual splitting of the root.ext3 file
    which can be taken care of by the -c argument of our update.sh script.
- License texts do not get deployed to the root file system.

Linux Image V2.6 Beta 1 (March 31, 2016)

- Booting:
  - using the eMMC fast boot feature.
      This requires fusing the bootmode irreversibly into the i.MX 6.
      It will be done as part of the flashing process, refer to the flashing
      instructions mentioned above.
      Fast boot mode addresses issue 15990
      http://developer.toradex.com/software/linux/linux-software/release-details?view=all&issue=15990
- U-Boot boot loader:
  - added updt_fuse command required for the change to fastboot mode
- Linux kernel:
  - updated to 3.14.52
  - disable not serviced DCD/RI UART interrupts
  - fixed bug preventing gpio-leds dtb configuration
  - limit SPI clock to datasheet maximum of 23MHz
- Linux user-space:
  - deploy GPIOconfig now available for Colibri iMX6
  - deploy rttest package
  - use gstreamer 1.0. Note that some plugin names changed
- OpenEmbedded build system:
  - update OpenEmbedded from fido to jethro:
    - Firefox 38.2.1esr
    - gcc Linaro GCC 5.2-2015.11-2
    - glibc 2.22
    - systemd 226

  - repository linux-toradex branch toradex_imx_3.14.52_1.1.0_ga
  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

Known Issues:
- gstreamer freezes when generating its initial database on some modules:
    (gst-plugin-scanner:683): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: cannot register existing
    type 'GstImxCompositorPad'
    The following gets you around this:
      mv /usr/lib/libgstimxcompositor.so.0.12.0 /usr/lib/libgstimxcompositor.so.0.12.0.orig
      gst-inspect-1.0
      mv /usr/lib/libgstimxcompositor.so.0.12.0.orig /usr/lib/libgstimxcompositor.so.0.12.0
    Alternative one can uninstall libgstimxcompositor0
      opkg remove --force-depends libgstimxcompositor0
- On the Colibri iMX6DL the RAM configuration is not patched correctly, thus
    only 256MB are available. Fix in the 2015.04-toradex-next branch
    available.
- USB RNDIS is racy due to networkd bug and not started by default
- some USB Thumb drives don't work well in U-Boot
- connecting an analogue mic to the on module codec resets the codec, so that
    neither headphone out nor mic in works anymore. Workaround: Have mic
    connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn
- on first boot the resizing process adversely affects system performance for
    the first few minutes until completed
- Display resolution can be set for some output configurations, set the U-Boot
    environment variable vidargs accordingly.
