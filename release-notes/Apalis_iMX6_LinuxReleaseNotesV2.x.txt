      board: /sys/devices/soc0/soc.0/2100000.aips-bus/21a4000.i2c/i2c-2/2-0041/stmpe-adc/iio:device0/in_temp8_raw
  - Gigabit Ethernet (i.MX 6 errata, only 400 Mbps sustainable data rate)
  - eMMC ext3
  - serial console debug UART1
  - UART2, UART3 and UART4
  - optional RS485
  - I2C via /dev/i2c-X
  - 8-bit MMC card mmc1
  - 4-bit SD card mmc2
  - framebuffer console
  - HDMI audio
  - analogue audio playback and capture, resistive touch
    - audio noise is high on V1.0 HW, workaround is to set headphone volume
        to maximum and use the DAC volume
  - S/PDIF
  - SPI via /dev/spidev0.0 aka SPI1 and /dev/spidev1.0 aka SPI2
  - custom Ethernet MAC address
  - serial number and board revision
  - USB host port
  - USB audio driver
  - USB webcam
  - USB raw HID device /dev/hidrawX
  - USB device Ethernet RNDIS, disabled
  - automatic USB device/host/suspend detection aka full OTG support
  - analog input via IIO framework
  - parallel camera interface
  - CSI2 camera interface
  - CAN via can0 and can1
  - PCIe (regular ports and mini-PCIe slot)
  - SATA (regular port or mSATA slot)
  - DVFS power management
  - suspend LP1
  - watchdog
- Linux user-space
  - Firefox browser
  - Gstreamer playback
  - OpenGL
  - LXDE
  - resize rootfs partition to full eMMC capacity
  - GPIO config tool
- Display:
  - only first output used by X11
  - dual output on HDMI and LVDS, both in 1920x1080
  - single output on EDT 7" Display
  - single output to analog RGB, aka VGA output
  - resolution setting through modedb string in kernel command line

Not working or not tested:
- U-Boot boot loader
  - USB OTG1 support
- Linux kernel
  - IrDA
  - All UART control lines on V1.0 HW
  - SIM card
  - HDA audio IF on MXM connector (not possible with i.MX 6)
  - on V1.0 HW connecting an analogue mic to the on module codec resets the codec,
    so that neither headphone out nor mic in works anymore. Workaround: Have mic
    connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn
  - I2S / AC97 on MXM connector
- Linux user-space
  - Gstreamer encoding (not tested)
- Display:
  - on some monitors HDMI EDID does not negotiate correct timings,
      adding/removing mxc_hdmi.only_cea=1 to the kernel command line may help
  - more than one framebuffer used as a X screen
  - backlight PWM on V1.0 HW
  - DSI output
